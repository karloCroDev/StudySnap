**StudySnap** is a modern web app that is designed for students and learners to organize and learn interactively on their or others notes. Users can create subjects and store editable documents (notes) within them. Notes can be kept private or made public to share with others. A _Discover_ section allows users to explore all public notes, and clicking on a user’s name reveals all of their shared content.

Each document comes with integrated AI features. Users can ask AI questions about the document's content, generate quizzes based on it, or continue a previous conversation. Document owners have additional tools—such as AI-powered sentence completion, content transformation, or prompt-based generation with images.
